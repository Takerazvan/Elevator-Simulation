# Elevator Simulation

This project is an elevator simulation implemented in Python. It provides a basic framework for simulating the behavior of elevators in a multi-story building. The simulation allows you to observe and analyze the movement and efficiency of the elevators based on different parameters and configurations.

## Features

- Simulates the behavior of multiple elevators in a building with multiple floors.
- Configurable number of floors, elevators, and passenger requests.
- Supports different scheduling algorithms for elevator dispatching.
- Provides statistical analysis of elevator performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Takerazvan/Elevator-Simulation.git
   ```
